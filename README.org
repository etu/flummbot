* flummbot simple irc-bot
Simple IRC-bot I wrote in golang for my irc-channel.

** Current features
  - Authenticate to services
  - Join channels
  - Listen to the command =!tell <person> <message>=
  - Deliver =<message>= to =<person>= the next time =<person>= joins or say something
  - Save quotes with the command =!quote <message>=
  - Tell random quote with the command =!quote=
  - Join channels when requested by being invited. Also got a Whitelist.

** Install dependencies
#+begin_src shell
go get github.com/fluffle/goirc/client
go get github.com/fluffle/goirc/logging/glog
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
#+end_src

** Configure the bot
Copy the sample config =flummbot.sample.json= to =flummbot.json= and
change the values of =channel=, =nick=, =server= and possibly
=nickservIdentify= if you want it to register to services.

go build flummbot.go
#+end_src

** Starting the bot
I've included a systemd-service file that I use to start my bot.
