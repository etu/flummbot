* flummbot simple irc-bot
Simple IRC-bot I wrote in golang for my irc-channel.

** Current features
  - Authenticate to services
  - Join channels
  - Listen to the command =!tell <person> <message>=
  - Deliver =<message>= to =<person>= the next time =<person>= joins or say
    something
  - Save quotes with the command =!quote <message>=
  - Tell random quote with the command =!quote=

** Configure the bot
Copy the sample config =flummbot.sample.toml= to =flummbot.toml= and look
through the following sections.

*** Connection
Change the values of =channel=, =nick=, =server=, =tls= and =message=. You
can also specify =nickservidentify= to set a message to send to NickServ on
connect.

*** Database
=file= specifies file used for sqlite.

*** Tells
=command= specifies command used in the =!tell= module.

*** Quotes
=command= specifies command used in the =!quote= module.

*** Karmas
=command= specifies command used in the =!karma= module.

It also listenes words that ends with plusOperator and minusOperator (++ or
-- as default) to change the karmas.

*** Corrections
=separator= specifies which character that should be used as separator in
=s/foo/bar=-style corrections.

** Building the bot
#+begin_src shell
make build
#+end_src

** Starting the bot
I've included a systemd-service file that I use to start my bot.
