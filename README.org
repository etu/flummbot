  - Deliver =<message>= to =<person>= the next time =<person>= joins or say something
  - Save quotes with the command =!quote <message>=
  - Tell random quote with the command =!quote=
  - Join channels when requested by being invited. Also got a Whitelist.

change the values of =channel=, =nick=, =server= and possibly
